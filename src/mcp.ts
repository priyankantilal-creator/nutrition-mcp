const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Nutrition tracking: meals, water, weight, goals, and trends, per-user with timezone support.

All nutrition figures are estimates and this server does not provide medical or dietary advice.

Photo-based meal logging — when the user sends a photo of food, follow these steps in order:
1. Pick the flow. A packaged product with a visible barcode: transcribe the digits printed under the barcode and call lookup_barcode. A plate, bowl, or prepared meal: continue below.
2. Identify each distinct dish or food item in the photo.
3. Establish provenance: restaurant/takeout or homemade? It changes everything downstream, so settle it before asking anything else. Read the photo for cues — restaurant plating, branded packaging or cups, a table setting in a venue, a tray — versus home tableware and a domestic background. If the cues are clear, state your read and let the user correct it ("Looks like this is from a restaurant — right?"). If they are not, just ask. Homemade: skip to step 6. Restaurant: continue to step 4.
4. Restaurant path — ask which restaurant it is and where it's located (city, or neighbourhood for a chain with many branches). Ask both in one message; they are a single natural question. Then search the web for that restaurant's menu.
   - Chains and fast food (McDonald's, Starbucks, Pret, and similar) usually publish full per-item nutrition. Find the specific item and use those numbers; they beat any estimate.
   - Independent restaurants usually publish a menu with dish names and ingredient lists but NO macros. Use the menu to identify which dish the photo shows and what is actually in it (the ingredient list is the real value — it reveals butter, cream, oil, and sugar that the photo hides), then estimate macros from those ingredients and the visible portion.
   - If you cannot find the menu — or cannot tell which of several dishes it is — say so plainly, make your best assumption, and put it to the user as a question. Never present a guess as if it came from the menu.
   - Be honest about where each number came from. Published chain nutrition is reliable; a macro figure from a recipe aggregator or a random site is not, and a dish cooked in a restaurant kitchen is usually richer than the same dish cooked at home. Say which of these you are working from, and do not dress up an estimate as verified data.
5. Restaurant path, continued — also call search_meals for the dish and for the restaurant name. The user may have eaten there before, and a past log is better evidence than any web result.
6. Homemade path — call search_meals with a short keyword per dish, passing alternatives in both the conversation language and English (past logs may be in either). Past variations reveal ingredients invisible in the photo (raisins vs banana, milk vs water, added honey or oil). Offer them as options: "Is this the oatmeal with raisins like Monday, or with banana, or something else?"
7. Estimate portions in household measures the user can verify at a glance — "a glass of", "a handful of", "a tablespoon of", "half the plate" — never grams or ounces (nobody can weigh food from a photo). For a restaurant meal, what matters most is how much of the serving was actually eaten: ask whether they finished it, left some, or shared it.
8. Interview the user — this is a multi-turn conversation, not a single confirmation step. Build a checklist of every open question across all dishes: which variation or menu item each dish is, how much of each the user actually ate, and any ingredient the photo cannot show (oil, butter, sugar, dressing, sauce, what a drink was made with). On the restaurant path, any dish you could not pin down from the menu is a checklist item too. Then work through that checklist ONE question per message. Ask the single most impactful open question, wait for the answer, let it update your assumptions, and ask the next. Do NOT batch the whole checklist into one message and do NOT stop after the first answer — a single round-trip is not an interview.
9. Keep going until every item on the checklist is resolved. Before each question it helps to note what is already settled and what is still open ("Got it — oatmeal with raisins. Two things left: how much you ate, and whether there was honey"). When the checklist is empty, summarize the full meal as you understand it and ask for a final yes before logging. Never log straight from a photo, and never log while any checklist item is still open.
10. When logging, write the confirmed household-measure portions into the meal description itself (e.g. "Oatmeal (1 glass raw oats, 2 glasses milk) with banana and honey (1 tbsp)") so future search_meals results are self-describing. For a restaurant meal, name the venue and city in the description too (e.g. "Pad thai with chicken (1 plate, finished) at Thai Basil, Podil, Kyiv") — the next time the user eats there, search_meals surfaces this entry and its macros, which is better evidence than searching the web again. Put anything about sourcing that the user should be able to revisit in notes, e.g. whether macros came from published chain nutrition or from an estimate.

Keep the interview proportional: a single obvious item with one known past variation may need only one question, while a full plate with several dishes usually needs several. A restaurant meal you pinned down from published chain nutrition may need only the how-much-did-you-eat question. If the user says to just log it or otherwise signals impatience, stop asking, state your remaining assumptions plainly, and log.

For "log my usual X" requests, use search_meals the same way: search, then interview to confirm the variation and the amount before logging.

Importing history from another app — when the user wants to bring in past meals from MyFitnessPal, Cronometer, Lose It!, MacroFactor or a similar export:
1. If they have a FILE, call start_meal_import first and let them drive it. The importer reads and maps the file in the browser, so the rows never pass through you and cannot be mistranscribed, and it handles column mapping, batching and retries. Do not ask them to paste a file you could import properly.
2. Call bulk_import_meals directly only when the importer is not an option: the data is already pasted into the conversation, the user cannot use the panel, or the importer reports that this client will not let it save. Then parse the rows yourself and follow that tool's description exactly — in particular, compute the row count and calorie total from the source text with real counting rather than by re-reading what you just wrote, and dry-run first.
3. Never log a backfill by calling log_meal in a loop. It is rate-limited per call, so a single week of meals would exhaust the budget; one bulk_import_meals call carries up to 50 rows for the same cost.
4. Check get_timezone before any sizeable import and offer set_timezone if it is unset. Times without an explicit UTC offset are placed using the saved timezone, so correcting it afterwards moves every imported meal — onto an adjacent day for anything logged near midnight.
5. Show the user what was resolved before treating an import as done: the dry run echoes back the date, time and meal type for every row, and a misread date column shows up there rather than in the totals. Re-sending the same rows is safe — the server recognises them and skips them — so a retry after a failure or a timeout never duplicates anything.`;

// How alcohol should be rendered for the current user: the drink unit to gloss
// grams with, or null when alcohol tracking is OFF. Null is the gate, not a
// missing preference — an enabled user with no saved preference gets "us". See
// the alcohol opt-in note on registerTools: alcohol is always STORED, and this
// value decides only whether it is ever shown.
type AlcoholDisplay = DrinkUnit | null;

// ---------- Numeric bounds for the write tools ----------
//
// Why these live in the Zod schema and not in the handler: CLAUDE.md's rule
// ("bounds live in the handler, not in Zod") is specifically about
// bulk_import_meals, where a schema-level rejection fires BEFORE the handler and
// throws away the structured per-row report, the warnings and the analytics row
// — for what is that tool's single most common caller mistake. log_meal,
// update_meal and set_nutrition_goals have no such report to lose: their whole
// output is the one row they just wrote. There, rejecting in the schema is
// strictly better, because the alternative is a raw Postgres `check (fiber_g >=
// 0)` violation surfaced verbatim to the model.
//
// The upper bound is not cosmetic. zod 4's z.number() rejects Infinity but
// accepts 1e308 — and Math.round(1e308 * 10) / 10 IS Infinity, so a single
// absurd meal made every later get_nutrition_summary / get_goal_progress /
// log_meal for that date fail the SDK's outputSchema validation (those schemas
// are z.number(), which refuses Infinity) until the row was deleted by hand.
//
// The ceilings themselves live in src/import.ts and are re-exported here, so
// the same figure is accepted whichever way a meal arrives. They were briefly
// duplicated with a test that grepped the other file to catch drift; sharing
// one declaration removes the drift instead of detecting it.

Either way, estimate portions in household measures the user can eyeball (a glass of, a handful of, a tablespoon of — NOT grams; for restaurant servings ask how much of it they actually ate), call search_meals to see how similar meals were logged before and to surface ingredients that may be invisible in the photo, then interview the user across multiple turns — one question per message, covering which variation each dish is, how much they ate, and photo-invisible ingredients (oil, sugar, sauce, what a drink was made with) — until nothing is left open. Do NOT call this tool after a single question-and-answer round; a lone confirmation is not enough. Only call it once every open question is resolved and the user has approved a full summary of the meal (or has told you to stop asking and just log it). Write the confirmed household-measure portions into the description itself (e.g. 'Oatmeal (1 glass raw oats, 2 glasses milk) with banana') so future searches are self-describing, and for a restaurant meal name the venue and city too (e.g. 'Pad thai with chicken (1 plate, finished) at Thai Basil, Podil, Kyiv').",

(2) Call once with dry_run: true first whenever the rows came from parsing a CSV, a screenshot, or free text; check the resolved logged_at and meal_type echoed back for every row, show the user what will be imported, and only then call again with dry_run: false. Pass local times exactly as the file gives them and let the server apply the user's timezone; do not compute UTC offsets yourself, and do not guess a value you cannot find — omit the field and list the column in unmapped_columns instead. (3) Because those local times are placed using the user's saved timezone, check with get_timezone before a large import: if it is unset the server falls back to UTC, and correcting it afterwards moves every imported meal — including onto adjacent days for anything logged near midnight.

Use this BEFORE logging a meal from a photo: past variations reveal ingredients that aren't visible in the picture (raisins vs banana, milk vs water, added honey or oil) — turn each difference between variations into a question for the user rather than picking one silently, and ask those questions one at a time across several turns instead of batching them. Also use it for requests like 'log my usual breakfast': search, interview the user to pin down the variation and the amount, then log_meal. For a restaurant meal, search the restaurant name as well as the dish — a past visit to the same venue is stronger evidence than anything on the web. Pass short food keywords, not full sentences, and include the food name in every language the user may have logged in — always add an English alternative alongside the conversation language, e.g. [\"вівсянка\", \"oatmeal\"].",

Defaults to today in the user's timezone; if you don't know the current date, ask the user before calling.",

// restart and leave some clients (observed: a Claude connector) wedged in a
// "connected but no tools" state. Refusing the stream (spec-allowed: a server
